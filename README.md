# Principles of Programming Languages Reference

- [Direct download here](/principles-of-programming-languages-reference.pdf)

This repository contains the reference material for the course "Principles of Programming Languages" by professor Pradella at Politecnico di Milano.
Furthermore, it contains some snippets of code and examples that could be useful for the understanding of the course (or, at least, were for me).

All the material is licensed under the [Attribution Share Alike 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license.
Inside the PDF you can find the license and the list of contributors.

## Compiling the PDF and contributing

The PDF is generated using `latexmk`. There are no special needs or care to be taken, just run `latexmk` (or whatever LaTeX compiler suits your needs) in the root directory of the repository.

I tried so hard to remove all errors and typos from the document, but I'm sure there are still some. If you find any, please open an issue or a pull request.
Also, if you want to contribute with new content, examples, or anything else, feel free to open a pull request!
